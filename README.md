openal-soft
===========

A software implementation of OpenAL.  This version is borrowed from the Orx Game Engine (https://bitbucket.org/orx/orx).

To build for Android, have the Android NDK installed.  Open a command prompt and navigate to build\android\jni.  Run ndk-build.  This should build and output three versions of libopenal32.so, one for each supported architecture.
